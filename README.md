# USpoverty_x_vaxx_rates
A data science project in which I explore the relationship (or lack thereof) between poverty rates and vaccination rates in the US

The USV .r scripts are where I tried experimental code and data wrangling.
Specifically, USV Scratch was the rough draft and USV Clean Code was where I cleaned up the code for ease of use and reading.

The US Vaccination Rates.html file is the final product, in which I present my findings.
The accompanying .rmd and .md files are what it was built from.
